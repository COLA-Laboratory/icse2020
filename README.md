## Usage

> Please follow `INSTALL.md` before starting to run the code.

+ If you want to investigate the impact of parameter optimization on domain adpation part of CPDP, please run  `code\optADPT.py`;
+ If you want to investigate the impact of parameter optimization on classifiacation part of CPDP, please run `code\optCLF.py`;
+ If you want to investigate the impact of parameter optimization on whole parts of CPDP, please run `code\optALL.py`;
+ If you want to investigate the impact of parameter optimization on whole parts of CPDP but in a sequential way, please run `code\optSEQ.py`.

## scalability

> If you want to investigate more combinations (transfer learning algorithms + classification algorithms), please modify the following parts of code.

1. Add your transfer learning algorithms into `code\Algorithms\domainAdaptation.py`
2. Add your classification algorithms into `code\Algorithms\Classifier.py`
3. Modify the call format in `code\Alogrithms\Framework.py`
