The code is implemented in python. To use it, you have to meet the requirements (install listed packages). 

- Our experiment is based on `python==3.6`,  and we recommend to use `Anaconda`  environment.
- After creating the environment, you need  to install three-party packages (Use following command in your `Anaconda` environment)
  - `pip install hyperopt`
  - `pip install scikit-learn==0.20.4`
  - `pip install iteration_utilities`
  - `conda install tqdm`  
  - `pip install imbalanced-learn==0.4  `
  - `pip install func_timeout`
> If you choose to run the project directly without `Anaconda` environment, you should use `pip3` rather than `pip` to install above packages.

and then you can run the scripts by following the steps in `README.md`.
