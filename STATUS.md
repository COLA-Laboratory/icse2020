We are applying for the AVAILABLE and REUSABLE badge. There is a lack of thorough understanding about what are the impacts of automated parameters optimization on various CPDP techniques. We present the first empirical study that looks into such impacts on 62 CPDP techniques, 13 of which are chosen from the existing CPDP literature while the other 49 ones have not been explored before. Our study result and code is open to the public and can be reproduced based on the steps described in "README.md".
